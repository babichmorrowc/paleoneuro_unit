# Dinosaur Scavenger Hunt

## Ornithischian Dinosaurs

1. This dinosaur was originally thought to have 2 brains, one in the skull and another above its rear legs.

## Saurischian Dinosaurs

1. **Banana brain:** This dinosaur's brain is roughly the size of a banana, making it more intelligent than similarly sized carnivores.  
   In contrast to the way Jurassic Park portrayed it, this species had excellent eyesight, with a binocular range wider than hawks. They also have very large olfactory bulbs, indicating an excellent sense of smell.

2. **"Hand-robbers":** This member of the maniraptors ("hand-robbers") was an agile predator with a large brain that enabled it to chase and kill.  
   It was a close relative of *Troodon*, one of the smartest dinosaurs (AMNH does not have *Troodon* on display). Its skeleton is very similar to early bird skeletons.
