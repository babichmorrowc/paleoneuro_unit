# Introduction to Machine Learning: Decision Tree Activity

## Goals

The goal of this activity is to understand the intuition behind using decision trees to classify data.  

## Feature Extraction

Come up with a list of attributes that the shapes have. These could have to do with edges, angles, colors, anything you want! These attributes, known as features, are what you are going to use to create your decision tree. (In our actual data, the features are variables like brain to body mass ratio, or cerebrum to whole brain ratio.)

### Questions

1. What features did you come up with?

2. How did you choose these features? Do all of the features apply to all of the shapes?

## Decision trees

### Create a tree

Create a decision tree with up to 3 layers using some or all of the features you came up with. For each layer in the tree, split up your shapes based on the decision you create.

#### Questions

1. What features did you choose to use in your decision tree?

2. What shapes end up grouped together at the end of your tree?

### Apply the tree to new data

Now that you have created a decision tree, you can feed it new data (in the form of an additional shape). Apply the same series of decisions in your tree to the new shape.

#### Questions

1. What happens to the new shape in the tree? What other shapes is it grouped with?
